    This is multilink, a bot whose purpose is to redirect you to a set of pages, each opened in their own window. <br /> <br />

    The limitation of being able to open only in new windows, not tabs is built into browser and is not something that can be done programatically. <br />
    But there are browser specific solutions that may work and open the links in new tab(s) not window(s). Look <a href="tab-solution.html">here</a> for them. <br /> <br />

    By default multilink will only open the links once you press the redirect button but it's possible to open the links automatically. <br />
    In both cases you will need to allow multilink.herokuapp.com to open popup windows. <br />
    
    In the future there will be a setting to ignore automatic redirects and always require a button press. <br /> <br />

    You are using this site on your own responsibility. We cannot guarantee for the content behind any link or it's safety. <br /> <br />

    To learn how to use this bot take a look at <a href="usage.html">usage</a>. <br />

    <hr />

    The links you will be redirected to are :
    <ul id="links">

    </ul>

    <button id="redirect_btn" > Redirect </button>
