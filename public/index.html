    This is multilink, a bot whose purpose is to redirect you to a set of pages, each opened in their own window. <br /> <br />

    
    By default multilink will only open the links once you press the redirect button but it's possible to open the links automatically. <br />
    To be able to do so automatic redirects must be allowed. They are disabled by default. <br />
    In both cases you will need to allow multilink.herokuapp.com to open popup windows. <br /> <br />
    
    Automatic redirects are <span id="automatic-allowed"></span> <a id="allow-automatic-link" ></a> <br /> <br />

    The limitation of being able to open only in new windows, not tabs is built into browser and is not something that can be fixed without manual changes or browser extensions. <br />
    There are browser specific solutions that may work and open the links in new tab(s) not window(s). Look <a href="tab-solution">here</a> for them. <br /> <br />

    To configure the bot more go to <a href="settings">this page </a>. <br />
