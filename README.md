Multilink
--

There isn't much to this application.

You give it a list of links and it redirects you to those links opening them in new window(s) or tab(s).

To see it action go to:

`http://multilink.herokuapp.com/?links=www.google.com`

You can replace the value of links param with any link or a list of links, like this:

`multilink.herokuapp.com?links=www.google.com,www.yahoo.com,www.bing.com`
